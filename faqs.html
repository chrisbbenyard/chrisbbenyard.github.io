          <h4>How to shop online?</h4>
<p>Once you're done shopping, checking out is easy and secure. You may always view the items you have added to your Shopping Bag by clicking the "Shopping Bag" button on the top right of any page. You may also checkout by clicking on the "checkout" hyperlink located on any item detail page. Once you are viewing the contents of your shopping bag, you may adjust quantities in your bag by changing the number to the right of items, and then by clicking "update bag" after all quantity adjustments have been made.</p>
<h4>How do I checkout?</h4>
<p>Once you are ready to checkout with the items in your shopping bag, click on the €œcheckout€ button in your shopping cart. If you have already registered with us before, simply sign-in using your email address and the password that you created for the account. If you do not have an account, simply follow the simple steps to create an account and continue through the checkout process.</p>
<p>Based on the contracts and relationships we have with our vendors, the merchandise sold on our site is intended for personal use only, and not for resale. We reserve the right to cancel orders that appear to be for resale purposes.</p>
<h4>Item availability</h4>
<p>The item availability is listed in the product details page. All colors and sizes available will be shown and available to add to the shopping bag. Colors and sizes that are unavailable will be grayed out. Although we make every effort to keep sufficient stock of items listed on our site, occasionally we do sell out of certain products. If we are out of stock on an item that you've ordered, we will notify you via e-mail. Any changes will be reflected in your order total as well as your shipping confirmation.</p>
<h4>Do you have sizing information?</h4>
<p>We try to include as much accurate sizing information for each product as possible. We have also added a size charts link to every product in the product detail page. Reference the size charts to help determine your size when ordering. Because sizing and cut will vary between brands, please use this chart as a general guide to compare the various size scales. If you are between sizes or need assistance selecting the proper size, please contact Customer Service by email or phone.</p>
<h4>Which Payment Methods do you accept?</h4>
<p>We accept PayPal and the following credit cards: Visa, Master Card, and American Express.</p>
<h4>How can I track my order?</h4>
<p>You will receive an order confirmation once your order has been successfully transmitted. In addition, a shipping confirmation e-mail will be sent once your order has been shipped. This confirmation will include the tracking number for your package. You may check the status of your order at anytime by logging in to your account page. Once you login to your account using your email address and password, you will be able to view your €œOrder History€ and view past orders and current orders that you have placed.</p>
<h4>When will my order will shipped?</h4>
<p>Orders placed Monday-Friday before 11 AM PST will begin processing that day, excluding holidays, and usually ship within 1 business day pending availability and credit verification. All orders placed after 11 AM PST will begin processing the next business day. Orders placed on Friday after 11 AM PST will begin processing on the following Monday. We will contact you with a follow-up email if the merchandise you have selected is not currently in stock or if we need additional identification provided for credit verification. We do not offer Saturday delivery. *DELIVERY TIME DOES NOT INCLUDE SATURDAYS SUNDAYS OR HOLIDAYS</p>
